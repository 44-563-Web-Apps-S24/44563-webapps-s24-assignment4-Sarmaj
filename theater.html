    <h1>SAI TEJA SARVANI MAJJI Does Chekov Tonight</h1>
    <h2>THE CHERRY ORCHARD Anton Chekov</h2>
    <p>YASHA. The common people have come to say good-bye. I am of the
        opinion, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that they're good people, but they don't
        understand very much.
        
        [The voices die away. LUBOV ANDREYEVNA and GAEV enter. She is not crying
        but is pale, and her face trembles; she can hardly speak.]
        
        GAEV. You gave them your purse, Luba. You can't go on like that, you
        can't!
        
        LUBOV. I couldn't help myself, I couldn't! [They go out.]
        
        LOPAKHIN. [In the doorway, calling after them] Please, I ask you most
        humbly! Just a little glass to say good-bye. I didn't remember to bring
        any from town and I only found one bottle at the station. Please, do!
        [Pause] Won't you really have any? [Goes away from the door] If I only
        knew--I wouldn't have bought any. Well, I shan't drink any either.
        [YASHA carefully puts the tray on a chair] You have a drink, Yasha, at
        any rate.
        
        YASHA. To those departing! And good luck to those who stay behind!
        [Drinks] I can assure you that this isn't real champagne.
        
        LOPAKHIN. Eight roubles a bottle. [Pause] It's devilish cold here.
        
        YASHA. There are no fires to-day, we're going away. [Laughs]
