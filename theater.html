    <h1>SAI TEJA SARVANI MAJJI Does Chekov Tonight</h1>
    <h2>THE CHERRY ORCHARD Anton Chekov</h2>
    
    <p>
        <strong>YASHA.</strong> The common people have come to say good-bye. I am of the
        opinion, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that they're good people, but they don't
        understand very much.
    </p>

    <p>
        [<strong>The voices die away.</strong> <strong>LUBOV ANDREYEVNA</strong> and <strong>GAEV</strong> enter. She is not crying
        but is pale, and her face trembles; she can hardly speak.]
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>GAEV.</strong> You gave them your purse, Luba. You can't go on like that, you
        can't!
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>LUBOV.</strong> I couldn't help myself, I couldn't! [<strong>They go out.</strong>]
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>LOPAKHIN.</strong> [<strong>In the doorway, calling after them</strong>] Please, I ask you most
        humbly! Just a little glass to say good-bye. I didn't remember to bring
        any from town and I only found one bottle at the station. Please, do!
        [<strong>Pause</strong>] Won't you really have any? [<strong>Goes away from the door</strong>] If I only
        knew--I wouldn't have bought any. Well, I shan't drink any either.
        [<strong>YASHA carefully puts the tray on a chair</strong>] You have a drink, Yasha, at
        any rate.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>YASHA.</strong> To those departing! And good luck to those who stay behind!
        [<strong>Drinks</strong>] I can assure you that this isn't real champagne.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>LOPAKHIN.</strong> Eight roubles a bottle. [<strong>Pause</strong>] It's devilish cold here.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>YASHA.</strong> There are no fires to-day, we're going away. [<strong>Laughs</strong>]
